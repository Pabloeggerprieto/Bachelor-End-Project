# Bachelor-End-Project
Final Bachelor End Project


The entire dataset that was used in this project can be found at https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles and is called lichess_db_puzzle.csv.zst.

I have added a subset of this data (subset5000) of length 5000. I could not add the entire dataset on here, because of its size.

FULL_MOVE_MODEL.py: This is the model that predicts the entire piece at once
ONLY FIRST PIECE AND MOVE.py: This is the model that predicts the piece and the move for the first move.
ONLY FIRST SECOND AND MOVE.py: This is the model that predicts the piece and the move for the second move

When running the code, do it as follows:
1. Download the entire dataset
2. Run the LoadingData.py file (you may need to modify the path)
2. Run the .py file of each model as you wish
